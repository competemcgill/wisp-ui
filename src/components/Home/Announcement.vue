            Competitive Programming sounds cool, but you have no clue where to
            start? Took COMP 250 or 251 and craving some more algorithmic
            goodness? You're in luck: Compete McGill is hosting a Summer
            Training Program for Summer 2020.
            <br />
            <br />Participants will take part in a weekly reading group that
            discusses the mother of all textbooks: Competitive Programming 3. By
            the end of the summer, you'll have a decent understanding of all of
            the core algorithms needed for Competitive Programming, and a good
            amount of practice, especially coding them in Java and/or C++.
            <br />
            <br />At the start of every topic, check-in for the updated topics
            and questions.
            <br />
            <br />Discussion sessions take place on Discord every Saturday from
            2-3 pm so you can talk about the problem set and issues you're
            having with our workshop leads (world-class competitive programmers
            ðŸ˜‰).
            <br />
            <br />Finally, at the end of every topic, weâ€™ll have a friendly
            competition so you can apply what you learn (all are welcome!!).
            Workshop leads will upload a video of their competition walkthrough
            for you to check out as well!
